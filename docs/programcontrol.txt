Testing plan:

Cipher.java
* Create own cipher and verify that it works properly
* In case of missing key file, throws exception
* In case key file is different lengths or has duplicates, throw exception
* Verify that punctuation does not change under the current system
* A different file path also successfully deciphers

FileHandler.java
* FileHandler sees that there are files within the directory and does see files that exist and doesn't accept any and all file calls
* FileHandler is capable of reading files
* Proper exception thrown when attempting to read a file that doesn't exist.

ProgramControl.java
* Ensure that the correct string is returned to userInterface upon calling
* Bad selection of file and keypath doesn't result in crash
* Edge case of empty file is still able to be read

UserInterface.java
* Verify that list files prints what's requested
* Verify file contents are printed
* Verify invalid file selection results in graceful exit
* Verify IOException is properly thrown
