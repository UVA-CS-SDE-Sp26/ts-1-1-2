Cipher design

Role D

Description:
This component will handle the ciphering feature. It will accept a ciphered string
and return it deciphered. The Cipher class will handle loading the Cipher key from a file,
validate the key, map the ciphered characters to their original characters, and decipher
string using key.

Pseudocode:
CLASS Cipher:
    METHOD decipher(cipherText: String, keyFile: Path) -> String:
        lines = read all lines from keyFile
        IF not 2 lines:
            THROW IllegalArgumentException("Key file must have exactly 2 lines")

        actualLine = trim(lines[0])
        cipherLine = trim(lines[1])

        CALL validateKey(actualLine, cipherLine)

        mapping = empty map
        FOR i = 0 to actualLine.length-1:
            mapping.put(cipherLine[i], actualLine[i])

        result = empty string
        FOR each character c in cipherText:
            IF mapping contains c:
                result += mapping[c]
            ELSE:
                result += c
        RETURN result

    METHOD validateKey(actualLine: String, cipherLine: String):
        IF actualLine.length != cipherLine.length:
            THROW IllegalArgumentException("Key lines must be same length")

        IF actualLine contains duplicate characters:
            THROW IllegalArgumentException("Duplicate character in actual line")

        IF cipherLine contains duplicate characters:
            THROW IllegalArgumentException("Duplicate character in cipher line")

Tests:

If key file contains two properly formatted lines, decipher() should return  original text for given ciphered string
If key file does not exist, decipher() should throw IOException
If two lines in the key file are not the same length, decipher() should throw IllegalArgumentException
If either line in key contains repeated characters, decipher() should throw IllegalArgumentException
Text containing spaces, commas, exclamation points, or other non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged in the output
Passing a different valid key file to decipher() should produce expected deciphered text
