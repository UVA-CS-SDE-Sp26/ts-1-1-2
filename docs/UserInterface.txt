UserInterface Design

Role A

Description:

This class handles all user interaction with the program.
It receives command line arguments, determines the user’s request,
calls the ProgramControl class to perform operations,
and prints the results to the console. Within this process, it will validate user
input and return an exit code. Exit codes are assigned as 0 for success and 1 for error.

Pseudocode:

Class: UserInterface

Constructor: (control: ProgramControl)
    store control reference

Method: run(args: String[]) -> int

    IF args length == 0
        PRINT control.getFileList()
        RETURN 0

    fileNumber = args[0]

    IF fileNumber is not two digits
        PRINT "Error: Invalid file query."
        RETURN 1

    TRY
        result = control.getFileContents(fileNumber, null)
        PRINT result

        IF result matches error statements from ProgramControl
            RETURN 1

        RETURN 0

    CATCH IOException
        PRINT "Error: Unable to read file."
        RETURN 1

Tests:

Running program with no arguments should print file list and return 0

Running program with invalid file number should print error and return 1

Running program with valid file number should print file contents and return 0

If ProgramControl throws IOException, run() should return 1
